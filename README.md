# CYR21
Cyrillic in Latin 
The goal of the project is to develop a method (technique, features) for encoding Cyrillic characters with Latin characters. Probably, the greatest interest in the project is held by the native speakers of the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian languages.
The meaning of this transition is to use one keyboard layout and one standard Unicode table. Of course, language switching is not excluded.
Currently, the Cyrillic alphabet alone is not enough to present materials in Cyrillic. The Latin alphabet is used everywhere in these materials, and every year the presence of the Latin alphabet becomes more and more. In my opinion, this can lead to a complete rejection of the Cyrillic language (for example, Russian) and the transition to English, or another European language.
